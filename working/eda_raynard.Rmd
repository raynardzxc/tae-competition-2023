Discrete Choice Model

```{r}
library(mlogit)
library(splitTools)
```

Note that the four alternatives (choice observations) are comparable, so we introduce alternate specific estimates.

```{r}
set.seed(42)
inds <- partition(data$class, p = c(train = 0.8, test = 0.2))
str(inds)
```

```{r}
train <- data[inds$train, ]
test <- data[inds$test, ]
```
